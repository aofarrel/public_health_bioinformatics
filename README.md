# Public Health Bioinformatics (PHB)
Bioinformatics workflows for characterization, epidemiology and sharing of pathogen genomes.

**More information about the steps undertaken in these workflows is available via the [Theiagen Public Resources Documentation](https://theiagen.notion.site/Theiagen-Public-Health-Resources-a4bd134b0c5c4fe39870e21029a30566).**

Support for running these workflows can be sought by raising a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/theiagen/public_health_bioinformatics/issues/new) or by contacting Theiagen at support@theiagen.com.

These workflows are written in [WDL](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl), a language for specifying data processing workflows with a human-readable and writeable syntax. They have been developed by [Theiagen Genomics](https://theiagen.com/) to primarily run on the [Terra.bio](https://terra.bio/) platform but can be run locally or on an HPC system at the command-line with Cromwell or miniWDL.
